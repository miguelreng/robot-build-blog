## Robotics SLA Performance

### 4-Week Comparison: 2025 vs 2026

<TelemetryChart 
  client:load 
  type="bar" 
  title="SLA 0-40m Performance Improvement" 
  xAxis="week" 
  yAxis="percentage"
  data={[
    {"week": "Week 2", "percentage": 68},
    {"week": "Week 3", "percentage": 69},

  ]} 
/>

<CalloutBox client:load type="success" title="Significant Improvement">
SLA under 40 minutes increased from 35% in 2025 to 68% in 2026. Orders over 50 minutes dropped from 44% to 18%.
</CalloutBox>

**Performance Metrics (Jan 5 - Feb 1, 2026):**

| SLA >50m | 44% | 18% | -59% |
| Total Orders | 9,991 | 10,574 | +5.8% |

**Key Insights:**
- Performance remained stable across all weeks despite snow disruptions
- Consistent delivery times even with weather challenges
- Volume increased while maintaining better SLA performance

### Highlights

**Robotics:**
- 🎯 Strong and smooth launch across all 16 campuses
