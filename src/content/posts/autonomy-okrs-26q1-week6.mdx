## O1: Boost Autonomous Performance KPIs (31.58%)

### US Winter Visit - 80% Complete

<CalloutBox client:load type="success" title="On Track">
Consolidated agenda of findings delivered. Feedback from team discussions and action items pending for February 6th deployment.
</CalloutBox>

**Key Achievements:**
- Comprehensive field testing completed
- Cross-team collaboration agenda finalized
- Deployment scheduled for fleet-wide release

### MTBF Reduction - 46.17% Complete

<CalloutBox client:load type="warning" title="Attention Needed">
MTBF decreased due to limited QA bandwidth preventing router issue fix. Release now on staging, deployment scheduled for February 6th.
</CalloutBox>
