# Computer Vision Improvements for Sidewalk Analysis

At Robot.com, we are continuously refining how our systems perceive the world. Our latest iteration focuses on the sidewalk analysis pipeline in Arlington, specifically addressing image quality and defect segmentations.

## Smart Quality Checks

Before we even attempt to detect defects, we now apply OpenCV-based quality filters. By analyzing blur, texture, and edge density, the system automatically rejects captures where the sidewalk isn't clearly visible. This dramatically reduces noise in our dataset.

## Deep Learning for Defect Detection

We’ve integrated UNet and YOLO-based segmentation models to detect gaps and surface anomalies. These aren't just raw outputs; they are combined with contextual rules to distinguish between actual defects and patterns caused by shadows or crosswalk paint.

The results are stored in BigQuery, enabling our team to conduct large-scale comparisons between AI predictions and manual annotations to drive continuous model refinement.
