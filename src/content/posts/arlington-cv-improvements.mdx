# Department Overview

As a Data Engineer, I focus on designing and optimizing scalable data pipelines, ensuring efficient data ingestion and transformation using tools like BigQuery, Apache Spark among others. I work on cloud-native architectures across GCP, implementing robust solutions for analytics, storage, and batch processing. Our department's goal is to empower the entire company with reliable, accessible, and high-quality data to drive informed decision-making.

# Achievements & Ongoing Initiatives

## Arlington – Sidewalk Image Analysis – Computer Vision Improvements 🛣️📸

We are improving the computer vision pipeline used to analyze sidewalk images in Arlington, focusing on increasing the reliability of both image quality validation and defect detection.

The system now applies smarter quality checks using OpenCV, combining blur detection, texture analysis, and edge density to automatically reject images where a sidewalk surface is not clearly visible. This helps reduce noise caused by irrelevant scenes, reflections, or low-quality captures.

For defect detection, we enhanced the pipeline by integrating pretrained deep learning models, including **UNet-based crack segmentation** and **YOLO-based segmentation** models for detecting gaps and surface anomalies. These models are combined with contextual rules to better distinguish real sidewalk defects from patterns caused by pavers, crosswalk paint, shadows, or surrounding vegetation.

> Within the Data Team, we process these results at scale and store them in BigQuery, enabling direct comparison between existing annotations and the new computer vision outputs to measure accuracy and continuously refine the models.

## Reliability Metrics

Our focus on eliminating low-quality captures has significantly improved the training set quality:
